                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Filmgeeks, the place where we make film and series choices a lot easier for you!
                    We
                    all know how difficult it can be to choose the perfect movie or series from the overwhelming
                    selection. Whether you're in the mood for excitement, laughter, crying, or just want to
                    relax,
                    we'll help you make just the right choice, tailored to your mood.</p>

        <h3>Movies and series based on your mood</h3>
        <p>
            Do you know that feeling? You feel like watching something, but you don't know exactly what. Maybe you're
            feeling upbeat and in need of a light-hearted comedy, or you've just had a rough day and want to immerse
            yourself in a compelling drama movie. That's why we're introducing a unique concept: recommendations based
            on your mood.</p>

        <h4>What can you expect?</h4>
        <p>
            In each episode, we provide reviews and recommendations of different films and series, going deeper into the
            quality, the storylines, the acting and the atmosphere. We talk about both the latest releases and hidden
            gems that you may not have discovered yet. But what really makes our podcast different is that we go beyond
            the standard movie reviews.</p>
